# Hi, professor! I changed my data to GooglePlay apps, and I found it could be suitable for multilevel regression. I finished my first draft of data cleaning, EDA and model fitting. I'm still working on my final report. I met two issues when I did model fitting and model validation. One is when I selected the better model, there was  something saying that "Model is nearly unidentifiable: very large eigenvalue - Rescale variables?", but I have already rescaled some of the variables with log transformation. Another one is about model validation, when I drew the leverage plot, I found that there were some points with high leverage and I thought it happened because the big data set. But I'm not sure about it. Could you give it a quick look at my model and give me some suggestions? So I can optimize my model again.Thank you!
